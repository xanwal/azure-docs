Triton is multi-framework, open-source software that is optimized for inference. It supports popular machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow, ONNX Runtime, PyTorch, NVIDIA TensorRT, and more. It can be used for your CPU or GPU workloads.

In this article, you will learn how to deploy Triton and a model to a managed online endpoint. Information is provided on using the CLI (command line), the AML Python SDK (v2), and Azure Machine Learning studio.

[!INCLUDE [preview disclaimer](../../includes/machine-learning-preview-generic-disclaimer.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> [NVIDIA Triton Inference Server](https://aka.ms/nvidia-triton-docs) is an open-source third-party software that is integrated in Azure Machine Learning.

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [basic prereqs](../../includes/machine-learning-cli-prereqs.md)]

* A working Python 3.8 (or higher) environment.

* Access to NCv3-series VMs for your Azure subscription.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > You may need to request a quota increase for your subscription before you can use this series of VMs. For more information, see [NCv3-series](../virtual-machines/ncv3-series.md).

[!INCLUDE [clone repo & set defaults](../../includes/machine-learning-cli-prepare.md)]

NVIDIA Triton Inference Server requires a specific model repository structure, where there is a directory for each model and subdirectories for the model version. The contents of each model version subdirectory is determined by the type of the model and the requirements of the backend that supports the model. To see all the model repository structure [https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/main/docs/model_repository.md#model-files](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/main/docs/model_repository.md#model-files)

The information in this document is based on using a model stored in ONNX format, so the directory structure of the model repository is `<model-repository>/<model-name>/1/model.onnx`. Specifically, this model performs image identification.

## Deploy using CLI (v2)

[!INCLUDE [cli v2](../../includes/machine-learning-cli-v2.md)]

This section shows how you can deploy Triton to managed online endpoint using the Azure CLI with the Machine Learning extension (v2).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For Triton no-code-deployment, **[testing via local endpoints](how-to-deploy-managed-online-endpoints.md#deploy-and-debug-locally-by-using-local-endpoints)** is currently not supported.

1. To avoid typing in a path for multiple commands, use the following command to set a `BASE_PATH` environment variable. This variable points to the directory where the model and associated YAML configuration files are located:

    ```azurecli
    BASE_PATH=endpoints/online/triton/single-model
    ```

1. Use the following command to set the name of the endpoint that will be created. In this example, a random name is created for the endpoint:

    :::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/deploy-triton-managed-online-endpoint.sh" ID="set_endpoint_name":::

1. Install Python requirements using the following commands:

    ```azurecli
    pip install numpy
    pip install tritonclient[http]
    pip install pillow
    pip install gevent
    ```

1. Create a YAML configuration file for your endpoint. The following example configures the name and authentication mode of the endpoint. The one used in the following commands is located at `/cli/endpoints/online/triton/single-model/create-managed-endpoint.yml` in the azureml-examples repo you cloned earlier:\

    __create-managed-endpoint.yaml__
    
    :::code language="yaml" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/endpoints/online/triton/single-model/create-managed-endpoint.yaml":::
    
1. To create a new endpoint using the YAML configuration, use the following command:

    :::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/deploy-triton-managed-online-endpoint.sh" ID="create_endpoint":::

1. Create a YAML configuration file for the deployment. The following example configures a deployment named __blue__ to the endpoint created in the previous step. The one used in the following commands is located at `/cli/endpoints/online/triton/single-model/create-managed-deployment.yml` in the azureml-examples repo you cloned earlier:

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > For Triton no-code-deployment (NCD) to work, setting **`type`** to **`triton_model​`** is required, `type: triton_model​`. For more information, see [CLI (v2) model YAML schema](reference-yaml-model.md).
    >
    > This deployment uses a Standard_NC6s_v3 VM. You may need to request a quota increase for your subscription before you can use this VM. For more information, see [NCv3-series](../virtual-machines/ncv3-series.md).

    :::code language="yaml" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/endpoints/online/triton/single-model/create-managed-deployment.yaml":::

1. To create the deployment using the YAML configuration, use the following command:

    :::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/deploy-triton-managed-online-endpoint.sh" ID="create_deployment":::

### Invoke your endpoint

Once your deployment completes, use the following command to make a scoring request to the deployed endpoint. 

> [!TIP]
> The file `/cli/endpoints/online/triton/single-model/triton_densenet_scoring.py` in the azureml-examples repo is used for scoring. The image passed to the endpoint needs pre-processing to meet the size, type, and format requirements, and post-processing to show the predicted label. The `triton_densenet_scoring.py` uses the `tritonclient.http` library to communicate with the Triton inference server.

1. To get the endpoint scoring uri, use the following command:

    :::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/deploy-triton-managed-online-endpoint.sh" ID="get_scoring_uri":::

1. To get an authentication token, use the following command:

    :::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/deploy-triton-managed-online-endpoint.sh" ID="get_token":::

1. To score data with the endpoint, use the following command. It submits the image of a peacock (https://aka.ms/peacock-pic) to the endpoint:

    :::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/deploy-triton-managed-online-endpoint.sh" ID="check_scoring_of_model":::

    The response from the script is similar to the following text:

    ```
    Is server ready - True
    Is model ready - True
    /azureml-examples/cli/endpoints/online/triton/single-model/densenet_labels.txt
    84 : PEACOCK
    ```

### Delete your endpoint and model

Once you're done with the endpoint, use the following command to delete it:

:::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/deploy-triton-managed-online-endpoint.sh" ID="delete_endpoint":::

Use the following command to delete your model:

```azurecli
az ml model delete --name $MODEL_NAME --version $MODEL_VERSION
```

## Deploy using Python SDK (v2)

[!INCLUDE [python sdk v2](../../includes/machine-learning-python-sdk-v2.md)]

This section shows how you can deploy Triton to managed online endpoint using the AML Python SDK (v2). 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For Triton no-code-deployment, **[testing via local endpoints](how-to-deploy-managed-online-endpoints.md#deploy-and-debug-locally-by-using-local-endpoints)** is currently not supported.

1. Import the required libraries and get a handle to the workspace
    ```python
    from azure.ml import MLClient
    from azure.ml.entities import ManagedOnlineEndpoint, ManagedOnlineDeployment
    from azure.identity import DefaultBrowserCredential

    subscription_id = '<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>'
    resource_group = '<RESOURCE_GROUP>'
    workspace = '<AML_WORKSPACE_NAME>'

    ml_client = MLClient(InteractiveBrowserCredential(),
                         subscription_id,
                         resource_group,
                         workspace)
    ```

1. To avoid typing in a path for multiple commands, use the following command to set a `base_path` variable. This variable points to the directory where the model and associated YAML configuration files are located:
    ```python
    base_path = 'sdk/endpoints/triton/single_model'
    ```

1. Set the name of the endpoint that will be created. In this example, a random name is created for the endpoint:

    ```python
    import datetime
    endpoint_name = "single-endpt-" + datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%m%d%H%M%f")     
    ```

1. Install Python requirements using the following commands:

    ```azurecli
    pip install numpy
    pip install tritonclient[http]
    pip install pillow
    pip install gevent
    ```

1. Create a YAML configuration file for your endpoint. The following example configures the name and authentication mode of the endpoint. The one used in the following commands is located at `sdk/endpoints/triton/single_model/create-managed-deploymnet.yaml` in the azureml-examples repo you cloned earlier:

    __create-managed-endpoint.yaml__

    :::code language="yaml" source="~/azureml-examples-sdk-preview/sdk/endpoints/online/triton/single_model/create-managed-endpoint.yaml":::

1. To create a new endpoint using the YAML configuration, use the following command:

    ```python
    import os.path
    endpoint = ManagedOnlineEndpoint.load(os.path.join(base_path, 'create-managed-endpoint.yaml'))
    endpoint.name = endpoint_name
    ml_client.begin_create_or_update(endpoint) 
    ```

1. Create a YAML configuration file for the deployment. The following example configures a deployment named __blue__ to the endpoint created in the previous step. The one used in the following commands is located at `sdk/endpoints/triton/single_model/create-managed-deployment.yaml` in the azureml-examples repo you cloned earlier:

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > For Triton no-code-deployment (NCD) to work, setting **`type`** to **`triton_model​`** is required, `type: triton_model​`. For more information, see [CLI (v2) model YAML schema](reference-yaml-model.md).
    >
    > This deployment uses a Standard_NC6s_v3 VM. You may need to request a quota increase for your subscription before you can use this VM. For more information, see [NCv3-series](../virtual-machines/ncv3-series.md).

    :::code language="yaml" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/endpoints/online/triton/single-model/create-managed-deployment.yaml":::

1. To create the deployment using the YAML configuration, use the following command:

    ```python
    deployment = ManagedOnlineDeployment.load(os.path.join(base_path,'create-managed-deployment.yaml'))
    deployment.endpoint_name = endpoint_name
    ml_client.begin_create_or_update(deployment)
    ```

### Invoke your endpoint

Once your deployment completes, use the following command to make a scoring request to the deployed endpoint. 

> [!TIP]
> The file `/sdk/endpoints/online/triton/single-model/triton_densenet_scoring.py` in the azureml-examples repo is used for scoring. The image passed to the endpoint needs pre-processing to meet the size, type, and format requirements, and post-processing to show the predicted label. The `triton_densenet_scoring.py` uses the `tritonclient.http` library to communicate with the Triton inference server.

1. To get the endpoint scoring uri, use the following command:

    ```python
    scoring_uri = endpoint.scoring_uri
    ```

1. To get an authentication token, use the following command:

    ```python
    auth_token = ml_client.online_endpoints.list_keys(endpoint_name).access_token
    ```

1. To score data with the endpoint, use the following command. It submits the image of a peacock (https://aka.ms/peacock-pic) to the endpoint:

    ```python
    from single_model import triton_densenet_scoring
    triton_densenet_scoring.score(scoring_uri, auth_token)
    ```
    The response from the script is similar to the following text:

    ```
    Is server ready - True
    Is model ready - True
    /azureml-examples/cli/endpoints/online/triton/single-model/densenet_labels.txt
    84 : PEACOCK
    ```

### Delete your endpoint and model

Once you're done with the endpoint, use the following command to delete it:

    ```python
    model_name = deployment.model.name
    model_version = deployment.model.version
    ml_client.online_endpoints.begin_delete(endpoint_name)
    ```

Use the following command to delete your model:

    ```python
    ml_client.models.archive(model_name, model_version)
    ```


## Deploy using Azure Machine Learning studio

This section shows how you can deploy Triton to managed online endpoint using [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml.azure.com).

1. Register your model in Triton format using the following YAML and CLI command. The YAML uses a densenet-onnx model from [https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/tree/main/cli/endpoints/online/triton/single-model](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/tree/main/cli/endpoints/online/triton/single-model)

    __create-triton-model.yaml__

    ```yml
    name: densenet-onnx-model
    version: 1
    path: ./models
    type: triton_model​
    description: Registering my Triton format model.
    ```

    ```azurecli
    az ml model create -f create-triton-model.yaml
    ```

    The following screenshot shows how your registered model will look on the __Models page__ of Azure Machine Learning studio.

1. From [studio](https://ml.azure.com), select your workspace and then use either the __endpoints__ or __models__ page to create the endpoint deployment:

    # [Endpoints page](#tab/endpoint)

    1. From the __Endpoints__ page, Select **+Create (preview)**.

        :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-deploy-with-triton/create-option-from-endpoints-page.png" lightbox="media/how-to-deploy-with-triton/create-option-from-endpoints-page.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing create option on the Endpoints UI page.":::

    1. Provide a name and authentication type for the endpoint, and then select __Next__.
    1. When selecting a model, select the Triton model registered previously. Select __Next__ to continue.

    1. When you select a model registered in Triton format, in the Environment step of the wizard, you don't need scoring script and environment.
