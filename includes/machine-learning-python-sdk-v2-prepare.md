The information in this article is based on code samples contained in the [azureml-examples](https://github.com/azure/azureml-examples) repository. To run the commands locally without having to copy/paste YAML and other files, clone the repo and then change directories to the `sdk` directory in the repo:

```azurecli
git clone https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples --branch sdk-preview
cd azureml-examples/sdk
```

If you haven't already set the defaults for the Azure CLI, save your default settings. To avoid passing in the values for your subscription, workspace, and resource group multiple times, use the following commands. Replace the following parameters with values for your specific configuration:

* Replace `<subscription>` with your Azure subscription ID.
* Replace `<workspace>` with your Azure Machine Learning workspace name.
* Replace `<resource-group>` with the Azure resource group that contains your workspace.
* Replace `<location>` with the Azure region that contains your workspace.

> [!TIP]
> You can see what your current defaults are by using the `az configure -l` command.

```azurecli
az account set --subscription <subscription>
az configure --defaults workspace=<workspace> group=<resource-group> location=<location>
```
