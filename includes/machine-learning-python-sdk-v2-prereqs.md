Before following the steps in this article, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

* An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a free account before you begin. Try the [free or paid version of Azure Machine Learning](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

* The [Azure Machine Learning Python SDK v2](/cli/azure/). For more information, see [Install, set up, and use the CLI (v2) (preview)](../articles/machine-learning/how-to-configure-cli.md).

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The CLI examples in this article assume that you are using the Bash (or compatible) shell. For example, from a Linux system or [Windows Subsystem for Linux](/windows/wsl/about). 
 
* An Azure Machine Learning workspace. If you don't have one, use the steps in the [Install, set up, and use the CLI (v2) (preview)](../articles/machine-learning/how-to-configure-cli.md) to create one.
